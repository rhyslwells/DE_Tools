can you use f strings in sqlite3 queries? and inject sql statments fo example a id =(f"{book_id}"?)
```

"""
    SELECT title FROM books WHERE id IN (x)
        INTERSECT
        SELECT book_id FROM translated WHERE translator_id = (
            SELECT id FROM translators WHERE name = 'Margaret Jull Costa'
        )
    );
"""

x="""SELECT book_id FROM translated WHERE translator_id = (
            SELECT id FROM translators WHERE name = 'Sophie Hughes'
"""
