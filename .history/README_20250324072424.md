# DE_Tools: Data Engineering Explorations  

This personal repository contains a series of structured explorations aimed at implementing and understanding various data engineering concepts. The primary objective is to develop a repository of generalised scripts that can implement concepts easily.  

This project is closely linked to the [Data Archive](https://rhyslwells.github.io/Data-Archive/), which provides additional context, and supporting resources.
