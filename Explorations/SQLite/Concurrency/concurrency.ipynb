    "# The notebook will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set up the SQLite database connection\n",
    "- Create a simple accounts table (if not already present)\n",
    "- Demonstrate race conditions by simulating concurrent transactions\n",
    "- Analyze inconsistent results\n",
    "- Apply proper transaction handling to prevent race conditions\n",

    "### Without Locks (Inconsistent Execution)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transaction 1 and Transaction 2 start at the same time**, both reading the initial balance of account ID `3` as **100**.\n",
    "2. **Transaction 2 updates account ID `1`** by adding **30**, setting its balance to **130**.\n",
    "3. **Transaction 2 updates account ID `3`** by subtracting **30**, setting its balance to **70**.\n",
    "4. **Transaction 1 updates account ID `1`** again, adding **30** to the previously read balance of **130**, making it **160**.\n",
    "5. **Transaction 1 updates account ID `3`** again, subtracting **30** from its own previously read balance of **100**, setting it to **40**.\n",
    "6. **Transaction 3 starts** and reads the balance of ID `1` as **160**.\n",
    "7. **Transaction 3 deducts 30 from account ID `1`**, bringing it down to **130**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Balances (Inconsistent Execution)\n",
    "- Account `1`: **130** (despite two separate transactions modifying it).\n",
    "- Account `3`: **40** (but Transaction 2 thought it was 70).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What went wrong?\n",
    "- **Transaction 1 and Transaction 2 both read 100 as the balance of account ID 3**, then deducted 30 separately, leading to **incorrect final values**.\n",
    "- **Transaction 1 and Transaction 2 did not account for each other's updates** when modifying balances, leading to incorrect deductions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### With Locks (Consistent Execution)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transaction 1 and Transaction 2 attempt to start, but SQLite's `BEGIN IMMEDIATE;` ensures only one executes at a time.**\n",
    "2. **Transaction 2 starts first and completes fully before Transaction 1 starts:**\n",
    "   - Reads balance of **100** for account ID `3`.\n",
    "   - Updates account ID `1` to **130**.\n",
    "   - Updates account ID `3` to **40**.\n",
    "3. **Transaction 1 now starts:**\n",
    "   - Reads balance of **100** (from a fresh query).\n",
    "   - Updates account ID `1` to **160**.\n",
    "   - Updates account ID `3` (which is now **40**) to remain consistent.\n",
    "4. **Transaction 3 reads the correct balance of account ID `1` as 160** and deducts **30**, setting it to **130**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Balances (Consistent Execution)\n",
    "- Account `1`: **130** ✅ (correct)\n",
    "- Account `3`: **40** ✅ (correct)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What was fixed?\n",
    "- **Transactions were forced to execute one at a time using locks.**\n",
    "- **No two transactions worked with outdated values simultaneously.**\n",
    "- **All updates were applied in the correct sequence.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "- **Race conditions occur when two transactions read the same value before either updates it.**\n",
    "- **Without locking, multiple transactions may update values incorrectly.**\n",
    "- **Using `BEGIN IMMEDIATE;` locks the table, ensuring one transaction finishes before another starts.**\n",
    "- **Final balances match expectations when transactions are executed sequentially, avoiding race conditions.**\n",
