    "| **Network access**       | ✅ Yes, allows remote connections | ❌ No, local file only |\n",
    "| **Database-wide permissions** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No, permissions are managed at the OS level |\n",

    "### **Why You Need MySQL for This Task**\n",
    "1. **User Privileges & Access Control**  \n",
    "   - You are testing `GRANT` and `REVOKE` commands to control what **Carter** can see and do.  \n",
    "   - SQLite does **not** have a built-in authentication system, so all users would have the same permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multi-user Environment**  \n",
    "   - In MySQL, you can create multiple users (`root`, `carter`) and assign **specific** privileges to each.\n",
    "   - SQLite is **single-user**; there’s no way to enforce different permissions per user.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Database Visibility (`SHOW DATABASES;`)**  \n",
    "   - MySQL supports `SHOW DATABASES;`, but SQLite does not because it manages only **one file-based database at a time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fine-grained Table/View Permissions**  \n",
    "   - MySQL allows **granular privileges** (`SELECT`, `CREATE VIEW`, etc.) on specific tables/views.  \n",
    "   - In SQLite, if a user has access to the database file, they can access **everything**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Would SQLite Work?**\n",
    "- **If you just wanted to test SQL queries on tables/views, SQLite could work.**  \n",
    "- **But for user-specific permissions (GRANT/REVOKE), SQLite is not an option.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, **MySQL (or another multi-user database like PostgreSQL) is necessary for testing access control and privileges.**"
